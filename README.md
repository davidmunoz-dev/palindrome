# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word or a number which reads the same backward or forward (that is for numbers, numbers invariant when reversed).

A n-iteration turnover palindrome is a number which leads to a palindrome after n-iterations of the following procedure:

1. reverse the number,

2. add both the number and its reversal to obtain a new number,

3. iterate from the first step until you get a palindromic number.

For instance: 121 is a 0-iteration turnover palindrome, 123 is a 1-iteration reversal palindrome and 4782 is a 3-iteration turnover palindrome.

The goal of this project is to find such iterated reversal palindromes, and the smallest number of iterations, in order to get a palindromic number, given the constraints on this number of iterations
